# Grey Infrastructure  
### Engineered and Structural Systems

**Grey infrastructure** consists of engineered systems designed to convey, store, protect, and manage water. It forms the mechanical and structural backbone of modern cities and works in tandem with ecological and intelligent systems under the GGBI Framework.

## Functions and Benefits

Grey infrastructure provides:

- **Drainage and conveyance**  
- **Flood protection and hazard mitigation**  
- **Water supply and storage**  
- **Flow regulation and control**  
- **Structural safety and reliability**  

---

## Examples

- Storm sewers, culverts, and channels  
- Levees, floodwalls, and seawalls  
- Dams, reservoirs, and pumping stations  
- Drainage tunnels and deep storage systems  
- Tide gates, sluices, and movable barriers

## Role in the GGBI Framework

Under GGBI, grey infrastructure:

- Works with **green infrastructure** to enhance runoff management  
- Interacts with **blue systems** across fluvial, estuarine, and coastal domains  
- Is strengthened by **intelligent infrastructure** through monitoring, analytics, and adaptive control  

Grey infrastructure remains essential for managing extreme events and ensuring system reliability, especially under climate change and urban intensification.
