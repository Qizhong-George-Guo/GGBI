# Blue Infrastructure  
### Rivers, Estuaries, Coasts, and Aquatic Systems

**Blue infrastructure** encompasses the hydrologic and hydraulic systems that transport, store, mix, and transform water—from rivers and lakes to estuaries, bays, and coastlines. These dynamic systems are central to watershed health and flood resilience.

## Key Processes

Blue infrastructure includes:

- **Riverine hydrology and hydraulics**  
- **Estuarine circulation and mixing**  
- **Tidal motion and storm surge**  
- **Sediment transport and geomorphic change**  
- **Watershed–estuary–coast interactions**  

---

## Examples

- Rivers, streams, and floodplains  
- Lakes, reservoirs, and ponds  
- Estuaries, tidal creeks, and embayments  
- Coastal wetlands and marshes  
- Beaches, dunes, and nearshore systems

## Role in the GGBI Framework

Blue infrastructure links upland systems with coastal environments. Under GGBI, it:

- Connects **green and grey systems** across spatial scales  
- Provides ecological and hydrologic services critical for sustainability  
- Benefits from **intelligent systems** for modeling tides, storm surge, sediment, water quality, and estuarine dynamics  

Blue infrastructure is essential for understanding whole-system behavior from rainfall to runoff, rivers to estuaries, and coasts to ocean.
