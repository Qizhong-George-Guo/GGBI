# Green Infrastructure  
### Ecological and Nature-Based Systems

**Green infrastructure** uses vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water, enhance resilience, and provide ecological and social co-benefits. It complements engineered systems and supports the broader GGBI vision by integrating hydrology, ecology, and landscape design.

## Functions and Benefits

Green infrastructure contributes to:

- **Infiltration and groundwater recharge**  
- **Runoff storage and peak flow reduction**  
- **Water quality improvement through filtration and uptake**  
- **Urban cooling and microclimate regulation**  
- **Habitat creation and biodiversity support**  
- **Social and aesthetic benefits**

## Examples

- Bioretention and rain gardens  
- Green roofs and green walls  
- Vegetated swales and infiltration trenches  
- Constructed wetlands  
- Floodplain reconnection  
- Urban trees and permeable landscapes

## Role in the GGBI Framework

Green infrastructure connects natural processes with engineered and intelligent systems. Under GGBI, it is:

- **Integrated with grey systems** to optimize hydrologic performance  
- **Linked with blue systems** to enhance watershed and estuarine health  
- **Supported by intelligence** through modeling, monitoring, and data-driven evaluation  

Green infrastructure is a foundation for nature-based resilience strategies across parcels, neighborhoods, and entire watersheds.
