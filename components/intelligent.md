# Intelligent Infrastructure & Systems  
### Sensing, Modeling, Data Analytics, Forecasting, and AI

**Intelligent infrastructure & systems** represent the computational and analytical foundation of the GGBI Framework. This domain integrates environmental sensing, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, data analytics, optimization, forecasting, and emerging AI technologies.

It transforms raw data and physical processes into actionable insight, supporting adaptive, resilient, and science-based decision-making.

### **2. Modeling & Simulation**
- Hydrologic and runoff models  
- Estuarine and coastal circulation models  
- Sediment transport and water quality models  
- Integrated watershed–estuary–coast systems modeling  

### **3. Data Analytics & Forecasting**
- Statistical and process-based forecasting  
- Climate and extreme-event projections  
- Scenario analysis and risk assessment  

### **4. Decision Support & Optimization**
- Flow control and pump/tide gate operation  
- Reservoir and stormwater system optimization  
- Emergency response and early warning  
- Multi-objective planning tools  

### **5. Artificial Intelligence & Computational Methods**

## Role in the GGBI Framework

Intelligent infrastructure strengthens all other domains:

- **Green + Intelligence:** performance monitoring, model-based design  
- **Grey + Intelligence:** flow optimization, adaptive operations  
- **Blue + Intelligence:** modeling tides, surges, estuarine dynamics  
- **Integrated:** whole-system forecasting, climate adaptation, risk-informed decision-making  

Intelligence serves as the unifying analytical layer, enabling cities and watersheds to function as **adaptive, informed, and resilient systems**.

## A Forward-Looking Domain

As climate extremes intensify, data grow richer, and AI advances rapidly, intelligent systems become central to future water and urban management.  

This domain reflects the evolution of both the field — and your own scholarship — toward integrated, computationally empowered solutions for the challenges of today and the uncertainties of tomorrow.
