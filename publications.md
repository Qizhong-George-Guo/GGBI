# Publications  
### Selected Works Relevant to the GGBI Framework

This page highlights a small number of publications and technical reports that relate directly to the **Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework** and its component domains. These works illustrate the evolution of integrated thinking across stormwater, watershed, estuarine, and coastal systems, as well as intelligent modeling and decision-support approaches.

A complete list of publications, technical reports, and media engagements can be found on the faculty website:
