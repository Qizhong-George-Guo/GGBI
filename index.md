# Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework  
### Integrated Infrastructure & Systems for a Changing World

The **GGBI Framework** brings together four foundational components of water and urban systems:

- **Green infrastructure** – ecological and nature-based solutions  
- **Grey infrastructure** – engineered and structural systems  
- **Blue infrastructure** – rivers, coasts, estuaries, and aquatic systems  
- **Intelligent infrastructure & systems** – sensing, analytics, modeling, and AI-driven decision support  

Together, these components provide a comprehensive foundation for **resilient, sustainable, and adaptive** cities, watersheds, and coastal environments.

## What is the GGBI Framework?

The GGBI Framework integrates **ecological**, **engineered**, **hydrologic**, and **intelligent** systems to address the full complexity of water challenges — from urban stormwater and flood mitigation to watershed resilience, estuarine processes, and coastal dynamics.

It emphasizes:

- System-scale understanding  
- Data-informed decision-making  
- Multi-infrastructure synergy  
- Adaptation under climate variability and change  
- Solutions rooted in both engineering and natural processes

## Why GGBI?

Rapid urbanization, climate change, extreme weather, and aging infrastructure require solutions that transcend traditional categories. **GGBI** provides a unified lens to:

- Understand cross-infrastructure interactions  
- Integrate green, grey, and blue systems  
- Incorporate intelligence into design and operation  
- Support planning across watersheds, coasts, and cities  
- Build long-term resilience and sustainability

## Applications

The GGBI Framework supports applications across:

- Urban stormwater and green stormwater infrastructure  
- Watershed and basin-scale planning  
- Estuarine and coastal processes  
- Flood resilience (pluvial, fluvial, coastal)  
- Sediment transport and water quality  
- Climate adaptation and nature-based solutions  
- Intelligent monitoring and modeling systems
