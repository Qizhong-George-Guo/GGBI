GGBI.ai – Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent Framework

This repository hosts the source code and content for GGBI.ai, the official website introducing the Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework.
The framework was developed by Professor Qizhong (George) Guo, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Rutgers University–New Brunswick.

GGBI provides a practical structure for integrating:

Green infrastructure – ecological and nature-based solutions

Grey infrastructure – engineered and structural systems

Blue systems – rivers, estuaries, coasts, and aquatic environments

Intelligent systems – sensing, data, modeling, and AI-supported analysis

The website presents conceptual descriptions, domain pages, application examples, and selected resources that reflect decades of research, teaching, and applied work across water and urban environments.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository supports the public-facing documentation of the GGBI Framework, including:

Framework structure: core concepts, definitions, and the four domains

Applications: stormwater, watersheds, estuaries, coastal systems, and multi-hazard resilience

Resources: publications, reports, teaching materials, and conceptual diagrams

Founder information: background on the development of the framework

The site is intended as an evolving resource for students, researchers, practitioners, and policy communities working on integrated water and urban systems.

Notes

The repository is updated periodically as new examples, diagrams, or materials become available.

The structure is intentionally lightweight and does not rely on themes, build systems, or external frameworks, for maximum transparency and longevity.

The site uses a fully custom layout designed for clarity, accessibility, and fast loading via GitHub Pages.
